JQ UI Date Select
=================

This is a rewrite of Tim Harper's "Calendar Date Select" gem
(https://github.com/timcharper/calendar_date_select) using the jQuery UI date
Cpicker.  This project is still in development and still far from working.

The projects intent is to simulate the ease of use of the original while:

- Updating the code to work with Rails 3
- Using the hosted jQuery UI infastructure to avoid local dependencies


TODO
----

- Allow for the choice to use different versions of jQuery and jQuery UI, or
  not include them all together
- Allow for the setting of Global options.


Contribute/Suggestions
----------------------
Suggestions and contributions to the project are welcome.
