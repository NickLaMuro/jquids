JQ UI Date Select
=================

This is a rewrite of Tim Harper's "Calendar Date Select" gem
(https://github.com/timcharper/calendar_date_select) using the jQuery UI date
Cpicker.  This project is still in development and still far from working.

The projects intent is to simulate the ease of use of the original while:

- Updating the code to work with Rails 3
- Using the hosted jQuery UI infastructure to avoid local dependencies


Contribute/Suggestions

Suggestions and contributions to the project are welcome.
